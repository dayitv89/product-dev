Kanban is a method for work management, originating from the Toyota Production System (TPS). It was created as a simple planning system, the aim of which was to control and manage work and inventory at every stage of production optimally. A key reason for the development of Kanban was the inadequate productivity and efficiency of Toyota compared to its American automotive rivals. With Kanban, Toyota achieved a flexible and efficient just-in-time production control system that increased productivity while reducing cost-intensive inventory of raw materials, semi-finished materials, and finished products.

From Japanese, Kanban is literally translated as sign board or visual signal.

Kanban is literally a board where there are 4 columns.

| Backlog | To Do | In Progress | Done |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

To develop a product via Kanban the whole team should follow these steps-

1. **Visualize the Workflow**

    The first and most important thing for you is to understand what it takes to get an item from request to a deliverable product. Only after understanding how the flow of work currently functions can you aspire to improve it by making the necessary adjustments. To visualize your process with a Kanban system, you will need a board with cards and columns. Each column on the board represents a step in your workflow. Each Kanban card represents a work item.

    When you start working on item X, you pull it from “To Do” column and when it is completed, you move it to “Done”. This way you can easily track progress and spot bottlenecks.

1. **Limit Work in Progress**

    Switching a team’s focus halfway through will generally harm the process, and multi-tasking is a sure route to generating waste and inefficiency; a primary function of Kanban is to ensure a manageable number of active items in progress at any one time. If there are no work-in-progress limits, you are not doing Kanban.

    Limiting WIP means that a pull system is implemented on parts or all of the workflow. Setting maximum items per stage ensures that a card is only “pulled” into the next step when there is available capacity. Such constraints will quickly illuminate problem areas in your flow so you can identify and resolve them.

1. **Manage Flow**

    The whole idea of implementing a Kanban system is to create a smooth healthy flow. By flow, we mean the movement of work items through the production process. We are interested in the speed and the smoothness of movement. So, managing the flow is about managing the work but not the people. So instead of micro-managing people and trying to keep them busy all the time, we should focus on managing the work processes and understanding how to get that work through the system faster. Ideally, we want fast and smooth flow. This would mean that our system is creating value quickly. This way we can minimize the average cycle time for production and avoiding the cost of delay, but in a predictable fashion.

1. **Make Process Policies Explicit**

    You can’t improve something you don’t understand. This is why the process should be clearly defined, published and socialized. People would not associate and participate in something they do not believe would be useful. When everyone is familiar with the common goal, they would be able to work and make decisions regarding a change that will move you in a positive direction.

1. **Feedback Loops**

    In order for the positive change to happen, succeed and continue, one more thing needs to be done.

    Such are the daily stand up meetings for team synchronization. They are held in front of the Kanban board and every member tells the others what he or she did the previous day and what will be doing today. There are also the service delivery review, the operations review, and the risk review meeting(depends on the product). The frequency depends on many factors, but the idea is that they are regular, at a strictly fixed hour, straight to the point and never unnecessarily long.
    The ideal average length of a stand up should be between 10-15 minutes, and others may reach up to an hour depending on the team size and topics.

1. **Improve Collaboratively (using models & the scientific method)**

    The way to achieve continuous improvement and sustainable change within an organization is through shared vision of a better future and collective understanding of the issues that need to be overcome.
    Teams that have a shared understanding of theories about work, workflow, process, and risk are more likely to build a shared comprehension of a problem and suggest steps towards improvement, which can be agreed by consensus.


So if we give a gist then, It has 4 things.
1. Backlog-
    
    Backlog is a place where all the user stories are stored, from here the stories which are to be kept priority are sent to requested part.
1. To Do-

    It is the place where all the stories which are to be done are kept.
1. In Progress-

    It is the place where your stories are kept on which you or your team is working.
1. Done-

    Last is the place where you transfer all the stories which you have completed.

So in all what is happening is there a place(or **Board**) where all your work is displayed, once a team member is free he/she comes and picks a work from the board and completes the work. As this requires team work, all the team members work closely.

There are four foundational principles of the Kanban Methodology that you need to know.
    
 - **Start with what you are doing now:**    
    The Kanban Method (hereafter referred to as just Kanban) strongly emphasizes not making any change to your existing setup/ process right away. Kanban must be applied directly to current workflow. Any changes needed can occur gradually over a period of time at a pace the team is comfortable with.
- **Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change:**     Kanban encourages you to make small incremental         changes rather than making radical changes that         might lead to resistance within the team and            organization.
- **Initially, respect current roles, responsibilities and job-titles:**
    Unlike other methods, Kanban does not impose any organizational changes by itself. So, it is not necessary to make changes to your existing roles and functions which may be performing well. The team will collaboratively identify and implement any changes needed.
- **Encourage acts of leadership at all levels:**
    Kanban encourages continuous improvement at all the levels of the organization and it says that leadership acts don’t have to originate from senior managers only. People at all levels can provide ideas and show leadership to implement changes to continually improve the way they deliver their products and services.
